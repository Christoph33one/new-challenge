TIC TAC TOE 


Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game that is played on a 3x3 grid. It involves two players, often represented as "X" and "O," who take turns marking spaces on the grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of their marks.

The game starts with an empty grid, and players alternate placing their respective marks in vacant spaces. Each player aims to strategically block their opponent's moves while simultaneously attempting to create their own winning line. The game continues until one player achieves a winning line or if all spaces on the grid are filled, resulting in a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that can be played by people of all ages. It offers opportunities for strategic thinking, planning ahead, and adapting to the opponent's moves. Its straightforward rules and quick gameplay make it a popular choice for casual entertainment and as a teaching tool for introducing basic concepts of game theory.
